# aframe-essentials
Usefull aframe components that should be available for everyone. 

This is all code I have had to use for another project, because of that some things might not work for your problem specifically. Just place an issue on here if something does not work as expected. If you want to do an PR you are more than welcome to.

As you can see this repo is far from usable. I have to still figue out how I want to distribute everything. For now potentially you can find your fix here though
